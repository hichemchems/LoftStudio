# Implementation Plan: Dockerization First, Then Phases 1-6

## Step 1: Dockerization Setup (Phase 7)
- [x] Create Dockerfile for backend (Node.js/Express)
- [x] Create Dockerfile for frontend (React)
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml with MySQL, backend, frontend services (no proxy)
- [x] Configure ports: backend 3001, frontend 3000, MySQL 3307 (adjusted to avoid port conflict)
- [x] Set up environment variables for Docker
- [x] Create .dockerignore files
- [x] Test Docker containers are running successfully
- [x] Fix frontend Node.js version issue (upgrade to Node 20) and rebuild image
- [x] Restart frontend container to use updated image and verify it runs without errors

## Step 2: Phase 1 - Foundation
- [x] Initialize project structure (backend/ and frontend/ folders)
- [x] Set up Git repository
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Define project architecture

## Step 3: Phase 2 - Backend Core
- [x] Initialize Node.js project in backend/
- [x] Install backend dependencies (express, sequelize, mysql2, etc.)
- [x] Set up Express server with middleware
- [x] Configure environment variables (.env)
- [x] Implement authentication (JWT, bcrypt)
- [x] Implement security (helmet, rate limiting, CSRF, etc.)

## Step 4: Phase 3 - Core API Functionality
- [x] Design and implement database schema (Sequelize models)
- [x] Create database migrations and seeders
- [x] Develop authentication endpoints
- [x] Develop user management endpoints
- [x] Develop package management endpoints (with update capability)
- [x] Develop sales, receipts, expenses, salaries endpoints
- [x] Implement business logic (turnover, profit, salaries, alerts)

## Step 5: Phase 4 - Advanced API Features
- [x] Add analytics and dashboard endpoints
- [x] Implement real-time updates (Socket.io)
- [x] Add data aggregation and reporting

## Step 6: Phase 5 - Frontend Development
- [x] Initialize React application in frontend/
- [x] Install frontend dependencies
- [x] Set up routing and protected routes
- [x] Create login/register components
- [x] Build admin dashboard with package management
- [x] Build user dashboard
- [x] Implement mobile-first responsive design

## Step 7: Phase 5 - Frontend Development
- [x] Install additional frontend dependencies (react-router-dom, axios, react-hook-form)
- [x] Set up routing in App.jsx with BrowserRouter, Routes, Route
- [x] Create AuthContext for authentication state management
- [x] Create ProtectedRoute component for route protection
- [x] Create Login component with form validation and API integration
- [x] Create Register component with form validation and API integration
- [x] Create AdminDashboard component with package management (list, create, update, delete)
- [x] Create UserDashboard component for viewing packages
- [x] Create PackageList component for displaying packages
- [x] Create PackageForm component for creating/editing packages
- [x] Implement responsive design in CSS
- [x] Update App.jsx to include routing and layout
- [x] Test all routes and functionalities
- [x] Ensure mobile-first responsive design

## Step 8: Phase 6 - Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test authentication and security
- [ ] Perform frontend testing
- [ ] Test Docker containers
- [ ] Add linting and formatting

## Step 9: Phase 8 - Employee Management System
- [ ] Create employee creation form with photo upload (nom, pr√©nom, email, password, pourcentage)
- [ ] Implement photo upload functionality for employee avatars
- [ ] Create employee cards on admin dashboard with avatar, name, package count, revenue, commission
- [ ] Add modal for detailed employee statistics (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly packages, commissions)
- [ ] Update backend API for employee management with photo handling
- [ ] Implement commission calculation based on HT (Hors Tax) packages

## Step 10: Phase 9 - Enhanced Package Management
- [ ] Update package CRUD with TTC (Toutes Taxes Comprises) and HT (Hors Tax) pricing
- [ ] Create package management interface with pricing fields
- [ ] Update backend models and API for dual pricing system
- [ ] Implement package statistics and revenue tracking

## Step 11: Phase 10 - Expense Management System
- [ ] Create expense categories (loyer, salaires, URSSAF, abonnements, divers)
- [ ] Build expense CRUD interface
- [ ] Implement profit calculation with expenses
- [ ] Add monthly expense tracking and budgeting
- [ ] Create expense reports and analytics

## Step 12: Phase 11 - Statistics Dashboard
- [ ] Build comprehensive statistics view with monthly/yearly data
- [ ] Implement revenue, profit, and expense charts
- [ ] Add forecasting and projections
- [ ] Create profitability threshold indicators

## Step 13: Phase 12 - Charts and Graphics
- [ ] Implement revenue charts (monthly/yearly)
- [ ] Create profit/loss charts with projections
- [ ] Add goal tracking charts for profitability targets
- [ ] Build interactive dashboard with multiple chart types
