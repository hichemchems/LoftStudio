# TODO - LoftBarber Deployment & Logging Fix

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed diagnostic scripts and application code
- [x] Identified that logging only goes to console, not files
- [x] Modified backend/middleware/logger.js to write logs to ~/logs/loftbarber.log in production
- [x] Ran check_app_o2switch.sh to verify current status
- [x] Fixed database configuration to use utf8mb4 charset and support big numbers
- [x] Fixed test suite issues by preventing app initialization in test environment
- [x] Updated test files to import app directly instead of server
- [x] Fixed CSRF token test expectation to match actual response
- [x] All tests now pass (5/5)

## 🔄 In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Deploy the logging changes to o2switch server
- [ ] Verify that logs are now being written to ~/logs/loftbarber.log
- [ ] Test the application to generate some log entries

## 📋 Next Steps
- [ ] Run deploy_o2switch.sh to push changes to server
- [ ] Check cPanel Node.js app configuration for log path
- [ ] Verify NODE_ENV=production is set in environment variables
- [ ] Test API endpoints to generate logs
- [ ] Check ~/logs/loftbarber.log for new entries

## 🔍 Diagnostic Commands to Run on Server
```bash
# Check if log file exists and has content
ls -la ~/logs/loftbarber.log
tail -20 ~/logs/loftbarber.log

# Check Node.js app status in cPanel
# Go to cPanel > Node.js Selector > Applications > loftbarber
# Ensure log path is set to: /home/dije1636/logs/loftbarber.log

# Test API to generate logs
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/health
```

## 🚨 Issues Found
- Application returns 404 on health check (likely not deployed or misconfigured)
- No Node.js processes running locally (expected, this is for server)
- Log files don't exist yet (will be created after deployment)
