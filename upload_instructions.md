# Upload Instructions for LoftBarber Frontend

## ✅ Build Completed Successfully!

The frontend has been built successfully on your local machine. Here are the files that need to be uploaded to o2switch:

### Files to Upload:
```
frontend/dist/
├── index.html (455 bytes)
├── vite.svg (1.5 KB)
└── assets/
    ├── index-CgW4wrZc.css (37.3 KB)
    └── index-CgcuMKXJ.js (546.9 KB)
```

### Upload Location on o2switch:
```
~/public_html/loftbarber/frontend/dist/
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Download the Built Files
- Locate the `frontend/dist` folder on your local machine
- Compress/zip the entire `dist` folder for easier transfer

### 2. Upload via FTP/File Manager
- Connect to your o2switch hosting via FTP or cPanel File Manager
- Navigate to: `public_html/loftbarber/frontend/`
- Upload the contents of the `dist` folder (not the folder itself)
- The files should end up in: `~/public_html/loftbarber/frontend/dist/`

### 3. Verify Upload
After upload, the structure should be:
```
~/public_html/loftbarber/frontend/dist/
├── index.html
├── vite.svg
└── assets/
    ├── index-CgW4wrZc.css
    └── index-CgcuMKXJ.js
```

### 4. Restart Node.js Application
- Go to cPanel > Node.js Selector > Applications
- Find your LoftBarber application
- Click "Restart"

### 5. Test the Application
- Visit `https://loft-barber.com`
- You should now see your full React application instead of the maintenance page!

## Troubleshooting:
- If you see the maintenance page, check that all files were uploaded correctly
- If you get 404 errors, verify the file paths in cPanel
- Make sure the Node.js app restarted successfully
